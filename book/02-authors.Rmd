### Save it in an accessible format

* Use tab-separated value (.tsv) or comma-separated value (.csv) files
* Use UTF-8 (or UTF-16) encoding to avoid problems in an international context (e.g., so characters like ü or é aren't mangled) 

Excel is less preferable because of the proprietary format and its tendency to mangle anything that resembles a date. SPSS and other proprietary formats are also not ideal, but data in a proprietary format is better than no data.

### Include a codebook

* <span class="beginner">Beginner</span>: include a text file with each column name and an explanation 
* <span class="intermediate">Intermediate</span>: You can include a data dictionary with further info like data type (string, numeric) or possible ranges/values [@buchanan2021getting]
* <span class="intermediate">Intermediate</span>: Use `faux::codebook()` to make a [machine-readable codebook](https://debruine.github.io/faux/articles/codebook.html) in PsychDS format
* <span class="intermediate">Intermediate</span>: Use the R [codebook](https://rubenarslan.github.io/codebook/articles/codebook_tutorial.html) to include a report with detailed metadata [@horstmann2020generating]


### Ethical Sharing

* Check that you are not sharing any identifiable data (without clear consent), such as names, student ID numbers, postcodes, IP addresses, or uniquely identifying combinations of demographic variables.
* Add a [license](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/library/research-support/research-data-management/licenses-data-sharing-creative-commons) so others know how they can use the data. The most common licenses for data are:
    * CC-0: Waives all rights and releases work to public domain
    * CC-BY: By Attribution, which permits sharing and reuse of the material, for any purpose, as long as the original authors are credited
    * CC-BY-SA: By Attribution, with a Share-Alike clause which means that anyone sharing or modifying the original work must release it under the same license
* [Practical tips for ethical data sharing](https://doi.org/10.1177/2515245917747656) (@meyer2018practical)

### Make it findable

* Use a persistent archive to host your data, like the [OSF](https://osf.io), [figshare](https://figshare.com/), or [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/). These platforms are free and can give your data a DOI.
* Include the citation info in a README
* Remember to make the data accessible for reviewers before submission. The OSF allows you to create a blinded [review-only link](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019930333-Create-a-View-only-Link-for-a-Project).
* Make the data accessible to the public before publication.
* Make sure the paper contains the correct links to the data before publication.

# Open Code

## Tips {#author-code-tips}

### Make it reproducible

* Include all the external files (e.g., data files) needed to run it
* Use relative paths so that it can run on any computer
* Set a seed if your code uses simulations or random number generation

### Make it clear

* Include a README that explains how to run the code
* Assume that the audience has varying technical expertise and doesn't necessarily know the conventions of the language you're using
* Indicate which parts of your code produce any figure, table, or value in your manuscript
    * <span class="beginner">Beginner</span>: include comments in your code like `# produces Figure 3.1`
    * <span class="intermediate">Intermediate</span>: Use code the generate the text of the results section so you only have one thing to copy and paste into the manuscript
    * <span class="advanced">Advanced</span>: Use code to generate the entire manuscript (e.g., using the [papaja](http://frederikaust.com/papaja_man/) package)

### Indicate software versions

* <span class="beginner">Beginner</span>: Include a text file with the info, e.g., devtools::session_info() in R, or requirements.txt in python
* <span class="intermediate">Intermediate</span>: Or use dependency management, like [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) or [packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/) in R
* <span class="advanced">Advanced</span>: Or use containers like [Binder](https://mybinder.org/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [CodeOcean](https://codeocean.com/) for full reproducibility
  
### Confirm reproducibility

* <span class="beginner">Beginner</span>: Access your shared materials from a new computer and run the code
* <span class="intermediate">Intermediate</span>: Or ask a colleague to try running your code on their machine
* <span class="intermediate">Intermediate</span>: Or set up more formal code review [@vable2021code] in your group
* <span class="advanced">Advanced</span>: Or use a service like [CodeCheck](https://codecheck.org.uk/)

NB: If your code takes a very long time to run, such as when you have extremely large datasets or are running simulations, you can include smaller test datasets or run a smaller number of replications and include code at the top of the script to toggle real and test data or low and high numbers of reps.

Finally, [make your code findable](#make-it-findable) using the same tips from the [open data section](#open-data). [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a common place to share code, but doesn't create a DOI, so if you use github, consider archiving a snapshot of your repository on [zenodo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content).

# Authorship

Specifying each author's roles allows for transparent attribution of credit, especially when papers have many authors. The Tenzing [r package](https://marton-balazs-kovacs.github.io/tenzing/) or [web app](https://tenzing.club/) app can help you manage this.

## Roles

* Conceptualization: Ideas; formulation or evolution of overarching research goals and aims.
* Data curation: Management activities to annotate (produce metadata), scrub data and maintain research data (including software code, where it is necessary for interpreting the data itself) for initial use and later re-use.
* Formal analysis: Application of statistical, mathematical, computational, or other formal techniques to analyse or synthesize study data.
* Funding acquisition: Acquisition of the financial support for the project leading to this publication.
* Investigation: Conducting a research and investigation process, specifically performing the experiments, or data/evidence collection.
* Methodology: Development or design of methodology; creation of models.
* Project administration: Management and coordination responsibility for the research activity planning and execution.
* Resources: Provision of study materials, reagents, materials, patients, laboratory samples, animals, instrumentation, computing resources, or other analysis tools.
* Software: Programming, software development; designing computer programs; implementation of the computer code and supporting algorithms; testing of existing code components.
* Supervision: Oversight and leadership responsibility for the research activity planning and execution, including mentorship external to the core team.
* Validation: Verification, whether as a part of the activity or separate, of the overall replication/reproducibility of results/experiments and other research outputs.
* Visualization: Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work, specifically visualization/data presentation.
* Writing - original draft: Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work, specifically writing the initial draft (including substantive translation).
* Writing - review & editing: Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work by those from the original research group, specifically critical review, commentary or revision -- including pre- or post-publication stages.
